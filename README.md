# pyreArcadeMode
I enabled a new game mode in Pyre. It is called Arcade mode. The programming isn't mine and all Supergiant Games', I just enabled the button. This is nto a mod, and thus cannot as easily be reversed. Be careful whenever editing game files. First get the lua file in the project, then go to GameLocation/Content/Scripts/UIScripts.lua then paste the code replacing line 46. Save then start Pyre.

# Playing Arcade Mode
To play the mdoe you have to go into the Multiplayer mode. Enter the pause screen and on the left side a btton that says Arcade mode should be there. Click on it and it will load in ARacde mode. Have fun!
